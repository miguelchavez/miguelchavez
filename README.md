# Hi, I'm Miguel Chavez Gamboa ðŸ‘‹

I've been working in software development since 2007, when I started [LemonPOS](https://github.com/lemonpos/lemonpos), a beautiful open-source Linux point-of-sale system. Since then, I've explored desktop, web, and mobile development, and even ventured into hardware as a hobby, building projects with Arduino and ESP32 boards.

My programming journey began in 1993 with Pascal and Delphi, expanded to C++, Java, and a bit of assembler during college, and later Python while working professionally. These days, I'm focused on JavaScript and modern web technologies.

LemonPOS opened the door for me to work remotely with clients around the world since 2009. I also contributed to the [CoinboxPOS](https://github.com/CoinboxPOS/coinboxpos) project, a cross-platform point-of-sale software written in Python and Qt.

I'm proud to have contributed to open source through LemonPOS, CoinboxPOS, and other projects, and I'm deeply grateful for the knowledge and support I've received from the community.

Let's keep building and sharingâ€”thanks for stopping by!
